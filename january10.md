### what is composition in programming?
- Like Inheritance, Composition is a concept in object-oriented programming that models the relationship between two classes. Composition involves using other classes to build more complex classes and there is no parent/child relationship exists in this case. Basically, complex objects are composed of other objects.
- Composition in programming refers to a design principle where a class or object is composed of other classes or objects, allowing for the creation of complex structures by combining simpler components. This is in contrast to inheritance, where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from a single superclass.
- There are two primary forms of composition: object composition and function composition.

##### Object Composition:
- In object-oriented programming, object composition involves creating instances of classes within another class, forming a relationship between the containing class (composite) and the contained classes (components). This allows for the creation of more modular and reusable code by assembling functionality from smaller, independent units.
##### Function Composition:
- In functional programming, function composition involves combining multiple functions to create a new function. This is often achieved through the use of higher-order functions or combinators. Each function in the composition takes the output of the previous one as its input.
##### Both forms of composition—object and function composition—promote code reuse, maintainability, and flexibility in designing software systems. They allow developers to build complex systems by assembling smaller, well-defined components.
### Widget Lifecycle:

- createRenderObject: Used to create the render object associated with the widget.
- updateRenderObject: Called when the widget needs to update its render object.

### App Lifecycle:

- main: The entry point of the app.
- runApp: Initializes the app and starts the WidgetsBinding.

### what is stateful widget lifecycle?

- Flutter is a UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. In Flutter, the lifecycle of a widget refers to the various stages a widget goes through during its existence. Understanding the widget lifecycle is crucial for managing state, performing cleanup, and responding to different events in your Flutter application.

- Here is a brief overview of the lifecycle methods for a StatefulWidget in Flutter:

- createState(): This method is called when the StatefulWidget is instantiated. It creates the mutable state object associated with the widget.

- initState(): This method is called when the StatefulWidget is inserted into the tree. It's the right place to perform one-time initialization tasks, such as initializing controllers or subscribing to streams.

- didChangeDependencies(): This method is called when the widget is created, and whenever the dependencies of the widget change. It's often used for tasks that need to be performed when the widget's dependencies (e.g., inherited widgets) change.

- build(): This method is called to build the UI of the widget. It is where you return the widget tree that represents the current state of the widget.

- didUpdateWidget(): This method is called whenever the parent widget rebuilds and provides the new widget as an argument. It allows you to compare the old and new widget to perform any necessary updates.

- setState(): This method is used to indicate that the internal state of the widget has changed. When called, it triggers a rebuild of the widget and its descendants.
- deactivate(): This method is called when the widget is removed from the tree. It allows you to perform cleanup tasks.
- dispose(): This method is called when the widget is removed from the tree. It's the place to perform cleanup tasks like canceling network requests or disposing of controllers.

- Understanding and properly utilizing these lifecycle methods is crucial for managing the state of your Flutter widgets and ensuring efficient resource usage. StatefulWidgets have more lifecycle methods than StatelessWidgets because they manage mutable state that can change over time.

### what is the application's lifecycle state?
- n Flutter, the application's lifecycle is divided into several states, and these states represent different phases of the application's execution. The states are defined in the AppLifecycleState enum. The didChangeAppLifecycleState method in the WidgetsBindingObserver interface is called whenever the application transitions between these states. Here are the main application lifecycle states:

- AppLifecycleState.inactive: This state indicates that the application is currently in the foreground, but it's not receiving user input events. This state is common during transitions between other states.

- AppLifecycleState.paused: The application is not visible to the user; it is either in the background or, on some platforms, completely terminated. In this state, the application might be suspended, and no processing is happening. This state is often triggered when the user switches to another app or puts the app in the background.

- AppLifecycleState.resumed: The application is in the foreground, and it can receive user input events. This is the normal operating state of the application when it's actively being used.

- AppLifecycleState.detached: This state indicates that the application is running as a background task, possibly with no direct UI. It is less relevant for most Flutter applications and is often associated with platform-specific behaviors.

- Here's an example of how you might use these states in conjunction with WidgetsBindingObserver:
```dart
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {
      // App is in the foreground
    } else if (state == AppLifecycleState.paused) {
      // App is in the background
    }
  }

  // Other widget lifecycle methods and UI building logic...
}
````
- By implementing WidgetsBindingObserver and listening to didChangeAppLifecycleState, you can respond to changes in the application lifecycle and perform necessary actions based on the current state of the app.
### WidgetsBindingObserver:
- In Flutter, WidgetsBindingObserver is an interface that allows objects to observe the lifecycle events of the widget tree. By implementing this interface, you can listen to various events related to the application lifecycle, such as when the application is paused, resumed, or inactive.
### what is the difference between adaptive and responsive in flutter?
- In the context of Flutter, the terms "adaptive" and "responsive" are often used to describe approaches to building user interfaces that work well across different devices and screen sizes. However, in the Flutter framework, these terms might be used in a slightly different context than in traditional web development.

##### Responsive Design in Flutter:

- In Flutter, "responsive design" often refers to creating UIs that can adapt to different screen sizes within the same device type, such as a mobile phone or tablet.
- Flutter achieves responsiveness by using flexible layouts, media queries, and the ability to adapt UI components based on the available screen space.
- The LayoutBuilder widget and media query information can be used to dynamically adjust the layout and appearance of widgets based on the screen constraints.
##### Adaptive Design in Flutter:

- In Flutter, "adaptive design" typically refers to creating UIs that can adapt not only to different screen sizes but also to different platforms and form factors, such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
- Flutter provides platform-aware widgets and APIs that allow you to create adaptive UIs that adjust their appearance and behavior based on the underlying platform.
- Widgets like CupertinoApp and MaterialApp are designed to adapt to the respective design languages of iOS and Android, providing a native look and feel on each platform.
##### In summary, in the context of Flutter:

- Responsive Design: Primarily focuses on adapting to different screen sizes within the same device type, adjusting layouts and components dynamically based on available screen space.

- Adaptive Design: Extends beyond screen sizes to consider different platforms and form factors, allowing the app to adapt its appearance and behavior to provide a more native experience on each platform.

- Both responsive and adaptive principles can be used in combination to create Flutter apps that provide a consistent and user-friendly experience across a variety of devices and platforms. The specific approach you choose depends on the goals and requirements of your application.
### what is the difference between plugin and packages in flutter ?

- In Flutter, plugins and packages are terms used to describe different aspects of the framework, but they serve different purposes.

##### Packages:

- A package in Flutter refers to a Dart package, which is a collection of Dart code and assets that can be easily shared and reused.
- Dart packages can contain Flutter widgets, utility functions, or any other Dart code that can be used across different Flutter projects.
- Packages are often published on the Dart Package Repository (pub.dev), making it easy for developers to discover and use them in their projects.
##### Plugins:

- A plugin, on the other hand, is a special type of package that integrates platform-specific (native) code with Flutter's Dart code. It provides a bridge between the Flutter framework and native code written in languages like Java (for Android) or Swift/ObjC (for iOS).
- Plugins are typically used when you need to access device-specific features or APIs that are not directly supported by Flutter.
- Common examples of plugins include camera plugins, location plugins, or plugins for using specific native libraries.
- In short: Native related developments.

- Flutter plugin is the wrapper of the native code like android( Kotlin or java) and iOS(swift or objective c). ... Flutter can do anything that a native application can through the use of Platform Channels and Message Passing. Flutter instructs the native iOS/Android code to perform an action and returns the result to Dart.
##### A "package" contains only Dart code.A "plugin" contains both Dart and Native code (kotlin/js/swift/...).
##### In summary, while a package is a broader term referring to a collection of Dart code and assets that can be reused, a plugin is a specific type of package designed to bridge the gap between Flutter and platform-specific (native) code, enabling access to device-specific functionality. Some plugins are packaged as Dart packages, and they might include both Dart and platform-specific code to achieve their goals.
### difference between futurebuilder and streambuilder?
- In Flutter, both FutureBuilder and StreamBuilder are widgets designed to simplify the process of working with asynchronous data and updating the UI based on the completion or updates of asynchronous operations. However, they are used with different types of asynchronous data sources.

##### FutureBuilder:

- Used when dealing with asynchronous operations that produce a single result.
- The FutureBuilder widget takes a Future and a builder callback function.
- The builder callback is called with the AsyncSnapshot of the Future, which represents the state of the asynchronous operation (e.g., ConnectionState.none, ConnectionState.waiting, 
 ConnectionState.done).
- The builder callback can use the data from the AsyncSnapshot to build the UI based on the current state of the Future.
```dart
FutureBuilder<String>(
  future: fetchData(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
      return CircularProgressIndicator();
    } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
      return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
    } else {
      return Text('Data: ${snapshot.data}');
    }
  },
)
```
##### StreamBuilder:

- Used when dealing with asynchronous operations that produce a sequence of values over time (a stream of data).
- The StreamBuilder widget takes a Stream and a builder callback function.
- The builder callback is called with the AsyncSnapshot of the most recent data emitted by the Stream.
- The builder callback is re-invoked whenever new data is available in the Stream, allowing the UI to update in response to changes in the data.
```dart
StreamBuilder<int>(
  stream: countStream(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
      return CircularProgressIndicator();
    } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
      return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
    } else {
      return Text('Count: ${snapshot.data}');
    }
  },
)
```
- In summary, use FutureBuilder when working with asynchronous operations that produce a single result, and use StreamBuilder when working with asynchronous operations that produce a continuous stream of data. Both widgets simplify the process of handling asynchronous data and updating the UI accordingly.
### WidgetsFlutterBinding:
- WidgetsFlutterBinding, which is a part of the Flutter framework and is responsible for initializing the binding between the Flutter framework and the underlying platform. It plays a crucial role in setting up the necessary infrastructure for running a Flutter application.
- Here are the key points related to WidgetsFlutterBinding:

##### Initialization:

- The WidgetsFlutterBinding class is used to initialize the binding for a Flutter application. It sets up the connection between the Flutter framework and the underlying platform (e.g., iOS or Android).
##### Binding Lifecycle:

- It manages the lifecycle of the binding, including the initialization and destruction of resources when the application starts and stops.
##### Event Handling:

- WidgetsFlutterBinding is responsible for handling input events, such as touch and keyboard events, and dispatching them to the appropriate parts of the Flutter framework.
##### Platform Integration:

- It provides a bridge between the Flutter framework and the platform-specific code. This allows Flutter to interact with the underlying platform's services and features.
- Here's a simple example of how WidgetsFlutterBinding is used in a Flutter application:
```dart
void main() {
  // Ensure that WidgetsFlutterBinding is initialized before runApp is called.
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```
- In the above example, WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() ensures that the binding is set up before calling the runApp function to start the Flutter application.

### types of scope in Dart?
- In Dart, the term "scope" refers to the region of code where a particular identifier (such as a variable or function) is accessible. Dart has lexical scoping, which means that the scope of a variable is determined by its location in the source code.
- There are several types of scope in Dart, including:

##### Global Scope:

- Variables or functions declared outside of any function or class have global scope.
- They are accessible throughout the entire Dart program.
```dart
var globalVariable = 42;

void main() {
  print(globalVariable); // Accessible in the main function
}
```
##### Local Scope:

- Variables or functions declared within a function or a block have local scope.
- They are only accessible within the function or block where they are declared.
```dart
void myFunction() {
  var localVariable = 10;
  print(localVariable); // Accessible only within myFunction
}
```
##### Class Scope:

- Members (fields and methods) of a class have class scope.
- They are accessible within the class where they are declared.
```dart
class MyClass {
  var classVariable = 5;

  void myMethod() {
    print(classVariable); // Accessible within MyClass
  }
}
```
##### Block Scope:

- Dart has block-level scoping, meaning that variables declared within a block (such as an if statement or a loop) are only accessible within that block.
```dart
void example() {
  if (true) {
    var insideIf = 'I am inside if';
    print(insideIf); // Accessible only within the if block
  }
  // print(insideIf); // Error: 'insideIf' is not defined in this scope
}
```
##### It's important to note that Dart uses a concept called "lexical scoping," where the scope of a variable is determined by its location in the source code. Understanding variable scope is crucial for writing clean and maintainable Dart code.



### what is the development and production branches in github?
- In the context of Git and GitHub, the terms "development branch" and "production branch" are not inherently predefined or special. However, these terms are commonly used in software development workflows to describe branches with specific purposes.

- Here's a typical scenario:
##### Development Branch:

- The development branch (often named "develop" or "dev") is where ongoing development work takes place. Developers create and merge feature branches into the development branch. This branch can be considered less stable than the production branch because it may contain work in progress and new features.
```
git checkout -b develop
```
##### Production Branch (Master/Main):

- The production branch (often named "master" or "main") is considered the stable branch. It should ideally represent the latest stable release of the software. When features in the development branch are thoroughly tested and ready for release, they are merged into the production branch.
```
git checkout -b main
```
##### Here's a simplified development workflow:

- Developers create feature branches (e.g., feature/new-feature) from the development branch.
- They work on and test features in their respective branches.
- Once a feature is ready for release, it gets merged back into the development branch.
- Periodically, the development branch is merged into the production branch to release stable versions of the software.

##### This separation between development and production branches helps maintain a stable and organized codebase. It allows for continuous development in the development branch while ensuring that the production branch represents a reliable version of the software.

##### Note: The choice of branch names (e.g., "develop" or "main") can vary between projects, and there's no strict convention enforced by Git or GitHub. The examples provided use common branch naming conventions.
### what is CI/CD and DevOps?
##### CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):

##### Continuous Integration (CI):

- CI is a software development practice where code changes from multiple contributors are automatically integrated into a shared repository multiple times a day.
- The main goal of CI is to detect and address integration issues early in the development process, promoting a more collaborative and agile development workflow.
- CI systems typically involve automated builds, automated testing, and code analysis to ensure that new changes do not introduce errors or break existing functionality.
##### Continuous Deployment (CD):

- Continuous Deployment is an extension of Continuous Integration that automatically deploys code changes to production environments after passing automated tests.
- With CD, the entire process from code commit to deployment is automated, reducing manual intervention and accelerating the release cycle.
- It enables frequent and reliable software releases, making it easier to deliver new features, improvements, and bug fixes to end-users.
##### DevOps:

- DevOps is a set of practices that aims to improve collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams.
- The goal of DevOps is to shorten the development lifecycle, increase the frequency of software releases, and enhance the quality and reliability of software.
- DevOps practices often include automation of repetitive tasks, continuous integration, continuous deployment, infrastructure as code (IaC), monitoring, and feedback loops.
- DevOps emphasizes a culture of collaboration, shared responsibility, and a focus on delivering value to users.
#### In summary, CI/CD is a set of practices and tools that automate and streamline the software development and deployment process. Continuous Integration ensures that code changes are regularly integrated and tested, while Continuous Deployment automates the deployment of changes to production environments. DevOps, on the other hand, is a broader cultural and organizational approach that aims to break down silos between development and operations teams, fostering collaboration and efficiency throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

### what is dev tools in flutter?
- In the context of Flutter, "DevTools" refers to a suite of tools and features that are designed to help developers analyze, diagnose, and debug Flutter applications. Flutter DevTools provide insights into the performance, state, and structure of your Flutter apps, making it easier to identify and address issues during development.

- Here are some key features of Flutter DevTools:

##### Inspector:

- The Inspector allows developers to explore the widget tree, inspect the properties of widgets, and understand the structure of their Flutter UI.
- It provides a visual representation of the widget hierarchy, making it easier to identify and debug UI-related issues.
##### Timeline:

- The Timeline provides a timeline view of the events occurring in your Flutter app, including frame rendering, UI events, and asynchronous operations.
- It helps identify performance bottlenecks, jank, and other issues affecting the smoothness of your app.
##### Debugger:

- The Debugger allows developers to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code during the debugging process.
- It integrates with IDEs like Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ to provide a seamless debugging experience.
##### Memory Profiler:

- The Memory Profiler helps identify memory leaks and inefficient memory usage in your Flutter app.
- It provides insights into the memory allocations and allows developers to analyze and optimize memory usage.
##### Network Profiler:

- The Network Profiler assists in monitoring network requests made by your Flutter app.
- It helps analyze the timing and details of network requests, making it easier to optimize and troubleshoot network-related issues.
##### Logging:

- DevTools provide a logging view that displays log messages generated by your Flutter app, making it easier to trace and debug runtime issues.
##### To use Flutter DevTools:

- Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed.
- Run your Flutter app in debug mode.
- Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (by default) to access the DevTools web interface.
- Alternatively, you can use the DevTools extension in Visual Studio Code or other integrated development environments (IDEs) for a more integrated experience.

##### Using Flutter DevTools is a valuable practice during the development of Flutter applications, helping developers create more performant and reliable apps.


### difference between REST API, GraphQL API, Webhooks?

- REST API, GraphQL API, and Webhooks are different approaches to building and interacting with web services, each with its own set of characteristics and use cases.

##### REST API (Representational State Transfer):

- Communication Style: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
- Data Structure: Data is typically transferred in JSON or XML format.
- Endpoint-Based: Each resource in a REST API is represented by a unique URL endpoint.
- Client Determines Data Shape: The client receives a fixed set of data from the server, and the client determines the shape and amount of data it needs.
- Stateless: REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to fulfill that request.
##### GraphQL API:

- Communication Style: GraphQL APIs use a single HTTP endpoint for queries and mutations, allowing clients to request precisely the data they need.
- Data Structure: Data is transferred in a JSON format.
- Flexible Data Retrieval: Clients can specify the exact shape and structure of the response data, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
- Single Endpoint: GraphQL APIs typically have a single endpoint for all operations.
- Real-Time Data: GraphQL supports real-time data with subscriptions, allowing clients to receive updates when data changes.
##### Webhooks:

- Communication Style: Webhooks are a mechanism for server-to-server communication. Instead of the client making requests, the server sends HTTP requests to a specified URL (endpoint) on the client server when a specific event occurs.
Event-Driven: Webhooks are event-driven, triggering actions on the receiving server in response to events on the sending server.
- Asynchronous: Webhooks are often used for asynchronous communication, allowing systems to communicate without the need for the client to constantly poll the server for updates.
- Payload: The payload of a webhook contains information about the event that occurred, and the receiving server processes this information.
##### In summary:

- REST API is endpoint-based, stateless, and provides a fixed set of data per endpoint.
- GraphQL API allows clients to request specific data shapes, reducing over-fetching, and supports real-time data with subscriptions.
- Webhooks enable server-to-server communication by triggering events on the receiving server in response to events on the sending server.
- The choice between REST, GraphQL, or Webhooks depends on the specific requirements of the application and the nature of the data and interactions involved.

### what is socket io and how to use it with flutter?
- Socket.IO is primarily a JavaScript library for real-time, bidirectional communication between clients (such as web browsers) and servers. While there is no direct Socket.IO library for Flutter, you can achieve real-time communication in a Flutter app by using a Flutter package that supports WebSocket communication.

- One such package is the web_socket_channel package, which provides a WebSocket implementation for Flutter. Here's a basic example of using web_socket_channel to create a WebSocket connection in a Flutter app:
- Add the web_socket_channel dependency to your pubspec.yaml file:
- Run flutter pub get to fetch the dependency.
- Use the package in your Flutter Dart code:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:web_socket_channel/io.dart';
import 'package:web_socket_channel/web_socket_channel.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final WebSocketChannel channel = IOWebSocketChannel.connect('ws://your_socket_server_url');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('WebSocket Example'),
        ),
        body: StreamBuilder(
          stream: channel.stream,
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            return Center(
              child: Text(snapshot.hasData ? '${snapshot.data}' : 'No data'),
            );
          },
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            channel.sink.add('Hello, WebSocket!');
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.send),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    channel.sink.close();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```
- In this example, the app establishes a WebSocket connection to a specified URL, and it can send and receive messages in real-time. The StreamBuilder widget updates the UI whenever new data is received.

- Note that the URL 'ws://your_socket_server_url' should be replaced with the actual WebSocket server URL you want to connect to.

- If you are building a Flutter app that communicates with a Socket.IO server, you might need to use a package like socket_io_client for Flutter, which is a Dart implementation of the Socket.IO client. Follow the package documentation for instructions on how to use it in your Flutter project.

### what is the difference between test api and production api?
- The terms "test API" and "production API" refer to different environments or instances of an API (Application Programming Interface) that are used for distinct purposes in the software development  lifecycle.

##### Test API:

- Purpose: The test API, also known as a development or sandbox API, is designed for testing and development purposes.
- Environment: It operates in a non-production environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible, but without affecting real users or data.
- Data: Test APIs often use dummy or simulated data, and their purpose is to allow developers to test their code, identify bugs, and ensure that the application works correctly.
- Access Control: Access to test APIs is usually more permissive, and sometimes they may not have the same security measures as production APIs.
##### Production API:

- Purpose: The production API is the live, operational version of the API that is used by real users and applications.
- Environment: It operates in the actual production environment and is optimized for performance, scalability, and reliability.
- Data: Production APIs handle real, sensitive data and are responsible for serving requests from live applications, making them crucial for the functioning of the actual product or service.
- Access Control: Production APIs are subject to strict access controls, authentication, and authorization measures to protect sensitive information and ensure secure interactions.
##### Key Differences:

- Data Integrity: Test APIs use simulated or test data, while production APIs handle actual, real-world data.
- Performance: Production APIs are optimized for high performance and reliability, as they are responsible for serving a large number of real users.
- Security: Production APIs have more stringent security measures to protect sensitive information, while test APIs may have more relaxed security settings.
- Usage: Developers use the test API during the development and testing phases, while the production API is used in the live environment by end-users.
- Access Controls: Access controls on production APIs are usually stricter to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data security.
##### It's essential to carefully manage and monitor the differences between test and production APIs to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data and to maintain the overall integrity and security of the system.



### Difference between Where and takeWhile ?
- where is a general-purpose method for filtering elements based on a condition, and it considers the entire iterable. On the other hand, takeWhile is specifically designed to take elements from the beginning of the iterable until the condition is no longer satisfied. The choice between them depends on your specific use case and whether you want to filter elements throughout the entire collection or only at the beginning.




### difference between count() custom() builder() extent() gridviews?

- In Flutter, SliverGrid and GridView are both used for creating grid layouts, and they can be configured using different methods. The count(), custom(), builder(), and extent() methods you mentioned are specific to SliverGrid, whereas GridView uses crossAxisCount, children, customDelegate, and extent properties directly. Here's a comparison:

#### SliverGrid Methods:
- count(): Specifies a fixed number of children in the cross-axis (e.g., columns in a grid) using SliverGrid.count.
- custom(): Allows you to provide a custom delegate that controls the layout of the sliver children using SliverGrid.custom.
- builder(): Similar to custom(), but specifically used with SliverList. It takes a SliverChildBuilderDelegate and a callback function that builds each child based on its index.
- extent(): Used with SliverGrid to specify a fixed cross-axis extent (width for vertical grids or height for horizontal grids) for the items in the grid.
#### GridView Properties:
- crossAxisCount: Specifies a fixed number of children in the cross-axis (e.g., columns in a grid) directly within GridView.
- children: Directly provides a list of widgets to be displayed in the grid.
- customDelegate: Allows you to provide a custom delegate for controlling the layout, similar to custom() with SliverGrid.
- extent: Specifies a fixed cross-axis extent (width for vertical grids or height for horizontal grids) for the items in the grid.

### Define factory constructors. in dart
- 
In Dart, a factory constructor is a special type of constructor that can be used to create instances of a class in a way that differs from the default behavior of a regular constructor. Factory constructors are often used when the process of creating an object involves complex logic or when you want to return an existing instance from a cache rather than creating a new one.

- Here's the general syntax for defining a factory constructor in Dart:
```dart
class MyClass {
  // Fields and other methods can be declared here

  // Regular constructor
  MyClass(/* parameters */) {
    // Initialization logic
  }

  // Factory constructor
  factory MyClass.factoryConstructor(/* parameters */) {
    // Factory constructor logic

    // It can return an instance of the class, possibly cached
    return MyClass(/* arguments for the regular constructor */);
  }
}
```

In Dart, a factory constructor is a special type of constructor that can be used to create instances of a class in a way that differs from the default behavior of a regular constructor. Factory constructors are often used when the process of creating an object involves complex logic or when you want to return an existing instance from a cache rather than creating a new one.

Here's the general syntax for defining a factory constructor in Dart:

dart
Copy code
class MyClass {
  // Fields and other methods can be declared here

  // Regular constructor
  MyClass(/* parameters */) {
    // Initialization logic
  }

  // Factory constructor
  factory MyClass.factoryConstructor(/* parameters */) {
    // Factory constructor logic

    // It can return an instance of the class, possibly cached
    return MyClass(/* arguments for the regular constructor */);
  }
}
- In the above example:

- The regular constructor is the default constructor that is used when creating an instance of the class using the MyClass() syntax.
- The factory constructor is declared using the factory keyword followed by the constructor name (factoryConstructor in this case). It can have its own custom logic for creating an instance of the class.
- The factory constructor returns an instance of the class, typically using the regular constructor or providing an existing instance.
- Here's an example illustrating the use of a factory constructor:
```dart
class Logger {
  String name;
  static final Map<String, Logger> _cache = {};

  // Regular constructor
  Logger(this.name);

  // Factory constructor
  factory Logger.getLogger(String name) {
    if (_cache.containsKey(name)) {
      return _cache[name]!;
    } else {
      final logger = Logger(name);
      _cache[name] = logger;
      return logger;
    }
  }
}
```
- In this example, the getLogger factory constructor is used to create instances of the Logger class. If a logger with the specified name already exists in the cache (_cache), it returns the existing instance; otherwise, it creates a new instance, adds it to the cache, and returns the new instance. This pattern can be useful for managing instances and ensuring that certain conditions are met during object creation.



### what are constructors?
- In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method or function that is used for initializing objects of a class. Constructors are called when an object is created, and their primary purpose is to set up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its fields or performing other necessary setup tasks.

- In Dart, constructors are defined within a class and have the same name as the class. Dart supports two main types of constructors:

#### Default Constructor:

- The default constructor is implicitly provided by Dart if no constructor is explicitly defined in the class.
- It initializes the instance variables to their default values, such as null for objects and 0 for numeric types.
- If you define your own constructor in the class, the default constructor is not automatically provided.
Example of a default constructor:
```dart
class MyClass {
  // Default constructor (implicitly provided if not defined)
}
```
#### Parameterized Constructor:

- A parameterized constructor is explicitly defined in the class and allows you to pass parameters to initialize the instance variables when creating an object.
- It enables you to provide custom initialization logic based on the values passed as arguments.
- Example of a parameterized constructor:
```dart
class Point {
  int x, y;

  // Parameterized constructor
  Point(int x, int y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}

// Creating an object using the parameterized constructor
var point = Point(2, 3);
```
#### Dart also supports named constructors and factory constructors:
#### Named Constructors:

- Named constructors are additional constructors with distinct names within a class.
- They allow you to create objects in different ways or with different initializations.
- Named constructors are invoked using the syntax ClassName.constructorName.
- Example of a named constructor:
```dart
class Point {
  int x, y;

  // Named constructor
  Point.origin() {
    x = 0;
    y = 0;
  }
}

// Creating an object using the named constructor
var originPoint = Point.origin();
```
#### Factory Constructors:

- Factory constructors are used when you want to control the process of object creation.
- They may return an instance of the class or a subtype, potentially from a cache, instead of always creating a new object.
- Factory constructors are defined using the factory keyword.
- Example of a factory constructor:
```dart
class Logger {
  String name;

  // Regular constructor
  Logger(this.name);

  // Factory constructor
  factory Logger.getLogger(String name) {
    // Custom logic, possibly returning an existing instance
    return Logger(name);
  }
}
```
- In summary, constructors in Dart are essential for initializing objects, and they provide flexibility in terms of default initialization, parameterized initialization, named ways of initialization, and custom control over the creation process through factory constructors.




### counter cubit
```dart

import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

/// {@template counter_cubit}
/// A [Cubit] which manages an [int] as its state.
/// {@endtemplate}
class CounterCubit extends Cubit<int> {
  /// {@macro counter_cubit}
  CounterCubit() : super(0);

  /// Add 1 to the current state.
  void increment() => emit(state + 1);

  /// Subtract 1 from the current state.
  void decrement() => emit(state - 1);

}
```
