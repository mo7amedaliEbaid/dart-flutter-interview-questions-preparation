# the range of int and double in dart.
- In Dart, int and double are two different numeric data types with different ranges.

- int: This represents integers (whole numbers) and has a fixed range. In Dart, the range of int is from -2^63 to 2^63 - 1 for 64-bit systems, and from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1 for 32-bit systems.

- double: This represents floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points) and has a larger range. Dart uses the IEEE 754 standard for representing double-precision floating-point numbers. The range of double is approximately ±4.9 × 10^−324 to ±1.8 × 10^308.
