- what is app life cycle in android and ios ?

- In mobile development, **app life cycle** refers to the sequence of states an app goes through from launch to termination, and how the OS manages transitions between those states. Both **Android** and **iOS** have well-defined life cycle methods/events.

## 📱 Android App Life Cycle

In Android, the **Activity** life cycle is the most important:

### Main Activity States

1. **onCreate()** →

   * Called when the activity is first created.
   * Initialize UI, variables, services, etc.

2. **onStart()** →

   * Activity becomes visible but not yet in focus.

3. **onResume()** →

   * Activity comes to the foreground and becomes interactive.

4. **onPause()** →

   * Another activity is taking focus.
   * Save unsaved data, pause animations, release camera/mic.

5. **onStop()** →

   * Activity is no longer visible (in background).
   * Release resources not needed when hidden.

6. **onDestroy()** →

   * Final clean-up before activity is destroyed.

7. **onRestart()** →

   * Called before `onStart()` when the activity is coming back to the foreground after being stopped.

👉 The flow usually looks like:
`onCreate → onStart → onResume → (running)`
then when leaving: `onPause → onStop → (possibly onDestroy)`

## 🍏 iOS App Life Cycle

In iOS, the life cycle is managed by **UIApplicationDelegate** (or **SceneDelegate** in newer iOS versions with multi-window).

### Main App States

1. **Not Running** →

   * App is not running at all (not launched or terminated).

2. **Inactive** →

   * App is running but not receiving events (e.g., when a call overlay appears).

3. **Active** →

   * App is running in the foreground and receiving user input.

4. **Background** →

   * App is in the background but still executing code for a short time.
   * Used for finishing tasks (uploading files, location updates, etc.).

5. **Suspended** →

   * App is in memory but not executing any code.
   * iOS can terminate it at any time if memory is needed.

### Key Delegate Methods

* **application(\_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)** → app started.
* **applicationDidBecomeActive(\_:)** → app entered foreground, interactive.
* **applicationWillResignActive(\_:)** → app is moving to inactive (e.g., home button press).
* **applicationDidEnterBackground(\_:)** → app went to background.
* **applicationWillEnterForeground(\_:)** → about to move to foreground.
* **applicationWillTerminate(\_:)** → app is about to terminate.

---

✅ **Summary**

* **Android** focuses on **Activity lifecycle** (`onCreate`, `onResume`, `onPause`, etc.).
* **iOS** focuses on **App states** (`active`, `inactive`, `background`, etc.).
* Both systems ensure smooth state transitions, resource management, and user experience.

Do you want me to also prepare a **side-by-side comparison table** (Android vs iOS) that you can use for interviews or documentation?

- what is equivalent to those in flutter app?
- Great question 👌 — since Flutter apps run on both **Android** and **iOS**, Flutter abstracts away the platform-specific life cycle (Android’s Activity & iOS’s UIApplication). Instead, Flutter gives us a **unified app life cycle** through **`WidgetsBindingObserver`**, **AppLifecycleState**, and some widget-level events.

## 🔄 Flutter App Life Cycle

### 1. **App Lifecycle States**

Flutter defines these in the **`AppLifecycleState`** enum:

* **`AppLifecycleState.resumed`** →
  Equivalent to **Android `onResume()`** / **iOS `active`**

  * App is visible and in the foreground, user can interact with it.

* **`AppLifecycleState.inactive`** →
  Equivalent to **iOS `inactive`** (no direct Android match)

  * App is in the foreground but not receiving user input (e.g., phone call overlay, app switch animation).

* **`AppLifecycleState.paused`** →
  Equivalent to **Android `onPause()` + `onStop()`** / **iOS `background`**

  * App is not visible to the user, running in the background.

* **`AppLifecycleState.detached`** →
  Equivalent to **Android `onDestroy()`** / **iOS `terminated`**

  * App is still hosted by the OS but detached from the Flutter engine. (Usually right before termination).

---

### 2. **Using WidgetsBindingObserver**

You listen for life cycle changes like this:

```dart
class MyAppLifecycle extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppLifecycleState createState() => _MyAppLifecycleState();
}

class _MyAppLifecycleState extends State<MyAppLifecycle> with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    print("AppLifecycleState: $state");

    if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {
      // App came to foreground
    } else if (state == AppLifecycleState.paused) {
      // App went to background
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container();
  }
}
```

## 📊 Side-by-Side Mapping (Android / iOS → Flutter)

| **Android**   | **iOS**              | **Flutter (`AppLifecycleState`)** |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `onResume()`  | `active`             | `resumed`                         |
| `onPause()`   | — (part of inactive) | `inactive` (briefly) → `paused`   |
| `onStop()`    | `background`         | `paused`                          |
| `onDestroy()` | `terminated`         | `detached`                        |
| —             | `inactive`           | `inactive`                        |

✅ So in Flutter, instead of handling Android & iOS separately, you just use **`AppLifecycleState`** to cover both platforms consistently.

Do you want me to also show you how to **test app life cycle changes in Flutter** (e.g., simulate background/foreground) so you can practice without deploying every time?

ok what is equivalent to those in flutter
onCreate() →

Called when the activity is first created.

Initialize UI, variables, services, etc.

onStart() →

Activity becomes visible but not yet in focus.
