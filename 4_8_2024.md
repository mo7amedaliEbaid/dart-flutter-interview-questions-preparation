## What are the ways to add real time functionality and how to integrate it with flutter?
- To add real-time functionality to a Flutter application, you can use various methods and technologies depending on your requirements. Here are some popular options:

- 1. Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that allows data to be stored and synchronized in real-time across all clients.
- Integration:
- Add the Firebase SDK to your Flutter project.
- Configure Firebase in your app using firebase_core.
- Use the firebase_database package to interact with the database.
- Listen to changes in the data using streams.
- 2. Firebase Cloud Firestore
- Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.
- Integration:
- Use the cloud_firestore package.
- Set up Firebase in your project and initialize Firebase in your Flutter app.
- Use Firestore to query data and listen to changes with snapshots.
- 3. WebSockets
- WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, which is useful for real-time data transfer.
- Integration:
- Use the web_socket_channel package to connect to a WebSocket server.
- Set up a WebSocket server (e.g., using Node.js, Django, etc.).
- Connect to the server and listen for incoming messages.
- 4. Pusher
- Pusher is a hosted service that makes it simple to add real-time data and functionality to web and mobile applications.
- Integration:
- Use the pusher_client package.
- Set up Pusher on your backend.
- Connect to the Pusher channel and bind to events to receive updates.
- 5. SignalR
- SignalR is a library for ASP.NET that adds real-time web functionality to applications.
- Integration:
- Use the signalr_core package to connect to a SignalR hub.
- Configure SignalR on the server.
- Establish a connection and listen for messages.
- 6. GraphQL Subscriptions
- GraphQL is a query language for your API, and subscriptions allow you to maintain a persistent connection to the server for real-time updates.
- Integration:
- Use the graphql_flutter package.
- Set up a GraphQL server that supports subscriptions.
- Use the web_socket_link for real-time data.
- 7. MQTT
- MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices, optimized for high-latency or unreliable networks.
- Integration:
- Use the mqtt_client package.
- Set up an MQTT broker.
- Connect to the broker and subscribe to topics for real-time updates.

## Facade Design Pattern
- It is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to complex subsystems , It defines a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use , hiding the complexities of the underlying system
```dart
// Component classes

class DVDPlayer {
  void on() => print("DVD Player is ON");
  void play(String movie) => print("Playing movie: $movie");
  void stop() => print("DVD Player stopped");
  void off() => print("DVD Player is OFF");
}

class Amplifier {
  void on() => print("Amplifier is ON");
  void setVolume(int level) => print("Amplifier volume set to $level");
  void off() => print("Amplifier is OFF");
}

class Projector {
  void on() => print("Projector is ON");
  void wideScreenMode() => print("Projector in widescreen mode");
  void off() => print("Projector is OFF");
}

// Facade class

class HomeTheaterFacade {
  final DVDPlayer dvdPlayer;
  final Amplifier amplifier;
  final Projector projector;

  HomeTheaterFacade(this.dvdPlayer, this.amplifier, this.projector);

  void watchMovie(String movie) {
    print("Get ready to watch a movie...");
    dvdPlayer.on();
    dvdPlayer.play(movie);
    amplifier.on();
    amplifier.setVolume(5);
    projector.on();
    projector.wideScreenMode();
  }

  void endMovie() {
    print("Shutting movie theater down...");
    dvdPlayer.stop();
    dvdPlayer.off();
    amplifier.off();
    projector.off();
  }
}

// Client code

void main() {
  var dvdPlayer = DVDPlayer();
  var amplifier = Amplifier();
  var projector = Projector();
  var homeTheater = HomeTheaterFacade(dvdPlayer, amplifier, projector);

  homeTheater.watchMovie("Inception");
  print("");
  homeTheater.endMovie();
}
```
