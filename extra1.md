- What is Software?
- Refers to a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks.
- It Includes programs, applications and other excutable files that enable computers to carry out various functions.

- What is Software Engineering?
- Software engineering is defined as the process of identifying user needs, then designing, creating, and testing software to meet those requirements. It is a discipline of engineering concerned with the growth of software products by the use of well-defined scientific concepts, methodologies, and procedures. It follows a set of principles, best practices, and procedures that have been fine-tuned through time, evolving as software and technology evolves. Software engineering results in a product that is dependable, efficient, and effective in its function.


- What are the various categories of software?
- Software products are mainly categorized into:

- System software: Softwares like operating systems, compilers, drivers, etc. fall into this category.
- Networking and web development software: Computer networking software offers the necessary functionality for computers to communicate with one another and with data storage facilities.
- Embedded Software: Software used in instrumentation and control applications such as washing machines, satellites, microwaves, TVs, etc.
- Artificial Intelligence Software: Expert systems, decision support systems, pattern recognition software, artificial neural networks, and other types of software are included in this category.
- Scientific software: These support a scientific or engineering user's requirements for performing enterprise-specific tasks. Examples include MATLAB, AUTOCAD, etc.

- What are the characteristics of software?
- There are six major characteristics of software:

- Functionality: The things that software is intended to do are called functionality. For example, a calculator's functionality is to perform mathematical operations.
- Efficiency: It is the ability of the software to use the provided resources in the best way possible. Increasing the efficiency of software increases resource utilization and reduces cost.
- Reliability: Reliability is the probability of failure-free operational software in an environment. It is an important characteristic of software.
- Usability: It refers to the user’s experience while using the software. Usability determines the satisfaction of the user.
- Maintainability: The ease with which you can repair, improve, and comprehend software code is referred to as maintainability. After the customer receives the product, a phase in the software development cycle called software maintenance begins.
- Portability: It refers to the ease with which the software product can be transferred from one environment to another.
- Apart from the above-mentioned characteristics, the software also has the following characteristics:

- Software is engineered, it is not developed or manufactured like hardware. Development is an aspect of the hardware manufacturing process. Manufacturing does not exist in the case of software.
- The software doesn't wear out.
- The software is custom-built.

- What is a framework?
- A framework is a well-known method of developing and deploying software. It is a set of tools that allows developing software by providing information on how to make it on an abstract level, rather than giving exact details. The Software Process Framework is the basis of the entire software development process. The umbrella activities are also included in the software process structure.

-  What is the main difference between a computer program and computer software?
- The key difference between software is a collection of several programs used to complete tasks, whereas a program is a set of instructions expressed in a programming language. A program can be software, but software the vice versa is not true.

- Describe the Software Development Process in Brief.
- The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a number of fundamental phases that teams must follow in order to produce and deliver high-quality software. Software typically goes through the following phases:

- Requirements Gathering: The team identifies, collects, and defines core issues, requirements, requests, and customer expectations related to the software application or service during this stage of the project. Generating software specifications, creating a thorough strategy, documentation, issue tracking, and project or product planning, including allocating the resources, are some tasks done during this phase.
- Software Design: The team makes software design decisions regarding the architecture and make of the software solution throughout this design phase of development.
- Software Development: Teams develop software solutions based on the design decisions made during earlier stages of the project
- Testing and Integration: Software is packaged and tested to ensure quality. Quality assurance, often known as testing, ensures that the solutions deployed fulfil the specified quality and performance criteria.
- Deployment: The software is installed in a production setting. The gathered, designed, built, and tested work is shared with the software service's customers and users.
- Operation and Maintenance: The software is installed in a production setting. The work is shared with the software service's customers and users.

- What is Debugging?
- Debugging is the process of finding a software bug, in the context of software engineering. To put it another way, it refers to the process of finding, evaluating, and correcting problems. Debugging is essential once the software fails to run properly.

- What do you understand by Gradle?
- Gradle is a build automation tool used in software development. It helps manage project dependencies, build processes, and task automation. It's often used for building and managing Java, Kotlin, and Groovy projects, among others.
- Gradle is an open-source built system whose main job is to take the project’s resources, source code, and other things related to it into an APK file. Gradle uses a stable programming language known as Groovy rather than using an HTML configuration file.

- Gradle build can easily handle anything related to the code of the program as Gradle’s build scripts are coded in a superior language. They are a regular program that uses Groovy instead of Java to write scripts. It also has a directed acyclic graph that determines the task’s order.

- What is Gradle Framework?
- It is a type of automated build system which is open source and creates builds on the concepts of Apache Ant and Maven. It uses a domain-specific language (DSL) which is based on Groovy to declare the configuration of the project. It doesn’t use the XML form that Apache Maven uses for this declaration.

- What are the benefits of working with Gradle?
- The benefit of using Gradle is that you get the best features of both Ant and Maven as Gradle is a combination of both frameworks. It is flexible due to Ant and provides configuration dependency management conversion due to plugins of Maven. 

- Other benefits include:

- Best support for various built-up work.
- It can support build for multi-projects.
- Gradle lets you publish the project and attach a library that is self-content and has the best resources and assets.
- Gradle enables the developer to customize and monitor the execution and configuration of the project to its center.
- It is highly scalable. From single build projects to enterprise-level build projects, it lets you build any project with high performance.

- Why developers prefer Gradle over other Frameworks?
- Developers prefer Gradle over other Frameworks because it uses Groovy for scriptwriting which has a similar syntax to Java. It is easy to understand and also offers support for multi-build projects.


- What are the limitations of Gradle?
- There are no known limitations of Gradle, and Gradle is preferred over Maven and Ant. However, in practice, it has been found that IDE integration is not good in Gradle. Secondly, the concept of parent projects that are capable of providing inheritable version numbers doesn’t exist in Gradle.
- Explain Groovy?
- Gradle uses a programming language that is written in script form, and the name of that script is Groovy. The features of this language are:

- It interoperates with Java easily as Groovy operates on JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
- To write a build script, you don’t have to learn Groovy.
- It is simple to write and read a Groovy due to its smaller codes than Java.
- It is a dynamic and flexible language that works somewhat similarly to Java. It is also compatible with the byte code of JVM.

### Generic programming is a programming paradigm that allows the creation of functions, classes, and data structures that operate on types generically. Instead of writing code for a specific data type, generic programming enables you to write code that works with a range of data types. This promotes code reusability and flexibility.<T>
### Data structures are the building blocks of any computer program as they help in organizing and manipulating data in an efficient manner. Without data structures, the computer would be unable to understand how to follow a program's instructions properly. It also defines their relationship with one another. 
### Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and others are examples of Data Structure. Data structures also provide clarity, organization and structure to the program's code while also helping the programmer ensure that each line of code performs its function correctly.
- What are Data Structures?
- A data structure is a mechanical or logical way that data is organized within a program. The organization of data is what determines how a program performs. There are many types of data structures, each with its own uses. When designing code, we need to pay particular attention to the way data is structured. If data isn't stored efficiently or correctly structured, then the overall performance of the code will be reduced.

- Why Create Data Structures?
- Data structures serve a number of important functions in a program. They ensure that each line of code performs its function correctly and efficiently, they help the programmer identify and fix problems with his/her code, and they help to create a clear and organized code base.
- Explain the process behind storing a variable in memory.
- A variable is stored in memory based on the amount of memory that is needed. Following are the steps followed to store a variable:
- The required amount of memory is assigned first.
- Then, it is stored based on the data structure being used.
- Using concepts like dynamic allocation ensures high efficiency and that the storage units can be accessed based on requirements in real-time.

- Can you explain the difference between file structure and storage structure?
- File Structure: Representation of data into secondary or auxiliary memory say any device such as a hard disk or pen drives that stores data which remains intact until manually deleted is known as a file structure representation.
- Storage Structure: In this type, data is stored in the main memory i.e RAM, and is deleted once the function that uses this data gets completely executed.
- The difference is that the storage structure has data stored in the memory of the computer system, whereas the file structure has the data stored in the auxiliary memory.
 - What is a stack data structure? What are the applications of stack?
- A stack is a data structure that is used to represent the state of an application at a particular point in time. The stack consists of a series of items that are added to the top of the stack and then removed from the top. It is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out) are two possible orders. A stack consists of a sequence of items. The element that's added last will come out first, a real-life example might be a stack of clothes on top of each other. When we remove the cloth that was previously on top, we can say that the cloth that was added last comes out first.
- Following are some applications for stack data structure:

- It acts as temporary storage during recursive operations
- Redo and Undo operations in doc editors
- Reversing a string
- Parenthesis matching
- Postfix to Infix Expressions
- Function calls order

- What is a queue data structure? What are the applications of queue?
- A queue is a linear data structure that allows users to store items in a list in a systematic manner. The items are added to the queue at the rear end until they are full, at which point they are removed from the queue from the front. Queues are commonly used in situations where the users want to hold items for a long period of time, such as during a checkout process. A good example of a queue is any queue of customers for a resource where the first consumer is served first.

### What is an Algorithm?
- Algorithms and Data Structures are a crucial component of any technical coding interview. It does not matter if you are a C++ programmer, a Java programmer, or a Web developer using JavaScript, Angular, React, JQuery, or any other programming language. 
- An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions used to solve a class of problems or conduct a computation in mathematics and computer science.
- Algorithms are used to specify how calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, automated decision making, and other tasks should be done. An algorithm is a method for calculating a function that can be represented in a finite amount of space and time and in a well defined formal language. The instructions describe a computation that, when run, continues through a finite number of well defined subsequent stages, finally creating "output" and terminating at a final ending state, starting from an initial state and initial input (possibly empty). The shift from one state to the next is not always predictable; some algorithms, known as randomised algorithms, take random input into account.
### Advatages:
- Algorithms boost the effectiveness of an existing method.
It is easy to compare an algorithm's performance to those of other approaches using various methods (Time Complexity, Space Complexity, etc.).
Algorithms provide the designers with a detailed description of the criteria and goals of the problems.
They also enable a reasonable comprehension of the program's flow.
Algorithms evaluate how well the approaches work in various scenarios (Best cases, worst cases, average cases).
An algorithm also determines which resources (input/output, memory) cycles are necessary.
We can quantify and assess the problem's complexity in terms of time and space using an algorithm.
The cost of design is also reduced if proper algorithms are used.

- How can we compare between two algorithms written for the same problem?
- The complexity of an algorithm is a technique that is used to categorise how efficient it is in comparison to other algorithms. It focuses on how the size of the data set to be processed affects execution time. In computing, the algorithm's computational complexity is critical. It is a good idea to categorise algorithms according to how much time or space they take up and to describe how much time or space they take up as a function of input size.

- Complexity of Time: The running time of a program as a function of the size of the input is known as time complexity.
- Complexity of Space: Space complexity examines algorithms based on how much space they require to fulfil their tasks. In the early days of computers, space complexity analysis was crucial (when storage space on the computer was limited).

- What is asynchronous programming?
- Allows tasks to be excuted independntly and concurrently without waiting for each other to complete ,
- It inables a non-blocking operations , allowing a program to continue processing other tasks while waiting for certain operations to finish.
